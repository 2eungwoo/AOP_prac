# AOP_prac aop-prac
> A repository for practicing with Spring AOP </br>
> This project demonstrates how to implement a custom AOP annotation to log method execution time. It also includes code that
reproduces the 'self-invocation' problem and solves it by refactoring the internal call to a separate service, which is a common AOP pitfall and a
best-practice solution(branch : fix/self-invocation)
